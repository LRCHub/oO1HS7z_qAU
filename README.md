[00:14.20] Your voice echoed through my mind
[00:20.74] Led me through abyss of chaos
[00:26.41] Finally you're here with me
[00:32.81] It is too surreal for me to blink
[00:49.31] 
[00:39.38] Just spin me back to your gravity
[00:45.90] I'll orbit you in every galaxy
[00:52.76] Tighten your grip if you doubt it's a dream
[00:58.76] Let my pulse speak for me
[01:02.15] All my pains are gone when you're near
[01:21.15] 
[01:23.25] The world is softly breathing
[01:29.88] As moonbeams filling up the void
[01:35.63] Every scratch we can't undo
[01:42.13] Is a bridge to tomorrow's dawn
[01:57.13] 
[01:48.34] Just spin me back to your gravity
[01:55.08] I'll circle you through all eternity
[02:01.83] Your fingertips pour moonlight all through me
[02:07.81] Rewrite the prophecy
[02:11.13] Suddеnly the sky has no limit
[02:25.63] 
[02:17.84] Are you real? Will you stay?
[02:21.09] Shall wе slow down our pace?
[02:24.38] Let this fleeting moment stretch to an endless always
[02:30.86] I'll reach for your hands again and again
[02:51.36] 
[02:38.10] Spin me back to your gravity
[02:44.24] I'll trace you across all possibilities
[02:51.08] So even if I am erased by time
[02:57.27] I'll follow echoes of memories
[03:01.95] To find you once more
